# resume
This site is my own resume. 
I decided to make resume as website, because i guess, that this is an interesting experience for me and for a potential
employer. 
To be honor, I am not a front-end developer (ha-ha, who could think that). I just tried to get some experience of this work,
and make this project useful :)
